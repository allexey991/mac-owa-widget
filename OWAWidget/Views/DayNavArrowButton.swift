/// One of the two day-stepping arrows in the popover's date bar.
///
/// The glyph stays small — the popover is dense — but the *target* does not. A bare `Image`
/// inside a `.plain` button is hit-testable only where the chevron's own strokes are, roughly
/// 7x11 pt, and users reported missing it on the first try.
///
/// Two things widen it. The chevron sits in a `chipWidth x chipHeight` rectangle that also
/// carries the hover shading — without that shading nothing would tell the user the target is
/// wider than the glyph. Around it, padding is folded *into* the tappable rectangle through
/// `contentShape` instead of being applied around the button, so the target runs to the popover's
/// edge, which is the cheapest place on screen to hit.
///
/// The two insets are deliberately unequal: a hair towards the window edge, the date bar's full
/// padding towards the label. Splitting it evenly would push the chevron visibly inwards, out of
/// line with the header above it.
