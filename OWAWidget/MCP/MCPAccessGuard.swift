/// Gatekeeper for the MCP server's read requests to Exchange: `GetCalendarEvent` (one meeting's
/// attendees and agenda) and the address book search. Creating a meeting waits for the user
/// instead and only checks that sync is not blocked.
///
/// - Refuses outright while sync is blocked (rejected password, untrusted certificate,
///   unapproved login host). Each OWA call re-submits credentials once on 401/440, so an agent
///   looping over meetings with a wrong password would otherwise walk the account into an AD
///   lockout.
/// - Feeds failures back into `CalendarService`'s circuit breaker, so MCP traffic latches the
///   block exactly as sync does.
/// - Caps the rate (60 per minute app-wide) and the concurrency (2).
